This is just a slight rationalization of what can be downloaded from the NI forum
at https://forums.ni.com/t5/Example-Code/REDIS-database-LabVIEW-toolkit/ta-p/3508602
Original autorship is attributed there to Martijn Jasperse.

Together with that, I have added the corrected pub-sub example of Carlo Sandroni,
mentioned in that thread, and
taken from https://github.com/carlosandroni/RedisLabviewPubSub. Undoing the separation
which probably has been done at its origin, I have, for my convenience, linked the project
items to their current location here.

I'm saving in LV2023 for my own convenience, not particularly interested in backcompatibility,
even though the original set is old and there is no reason it shouldn't work in previous LabVIEW versions.

Some OpenG Variant data Library VIs have been detached from the library and saved here for convenience
and to avoid a VIPM installation.
